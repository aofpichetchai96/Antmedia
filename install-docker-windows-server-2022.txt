## During the installation, if you encounter errors like "Failed to start service 'Docker Engine (docker)'" or "errors during connect", terminate the installation process by pressing CTRL+C and then run the installation script again.

## Docker installation requires a restart, so your Windows Server will automatically reboot in a few moments. Once the server is back up, it will finish the installation and show the message that Docker is installed.
## To confirm that Docker Engine is installed, run the docker version command:
docker version
